# Junie AI Assistant Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a project to create a (mostly thin) java-c binding for OpenXR. It makes extensive use of code generation 
(e.g. all structs are generated by StructGenerator). Gradle task parseOpenXrFile kicks off the whole generation task 
which calls into ParseOpenXr.java. 

## General Guidelines

1. **Focus on the Task**: Always prioritize addressing the specific issue or task described by the user.

2. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

3. **Documentation**: Add appropriate comments and documentation to explain complex logic or important decisions.

4. **Testing**: Ensure changes are properly tested before submission.

5. **Minimal Changes**: Make the minimal necessary changes to solve the problem. Avoid refactoring unrelated code.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and edge case management.

7. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of your changes.

8. **Security**: Be mindful of security best practices when modifying code.

9. **Method overloading** Update, don't overload. If you're asked to make a change to a method then update that method. Don't overload it and create a new method with the additional parameters unless explicitly asked to.


## Project-Specific Rules

1. **Respect the existing architecture** and coding patterns of the project.

2. **Follow the project's naming conventions** for consistency.

## Communication Guidelines

1. **Be Clear**: Provide clear explanations of your reasoning and approach.

2. **Be Thorough**: Ensure you've considered all aspects of the problem.

3. **Acknowledge Limitations**: If you're uncertain about something, acknowledge it rather than making assumptions.

4. **Provide Context**: When explaining your changes, provide context to help the user understand your decisions.
